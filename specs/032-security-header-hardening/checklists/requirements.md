# Specification Quality Checklist: Security Header Hardening (DAST remediation)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`
- The named HTTP security headers (content-security policy, anti-clickjacking, content-type-sniffing protection, referrer policy, transport-security) are treated as contract-level observable response behaviors, not implementation choices — they are mandated by the project constitution (§Transport Security: Security Headers / CORS / HSTS). They are described by behavior rather than by any specific middleware, library, or server code.
- Implementation mechanisms from the source PRD (specific Express/server layer, `helmet` vs hand-rolled, the CopilotKit runtime, `server.js`, allowlist file path) are intentionally deferred to plan.md.
