# Phase 1 Data Model: Feature 040

Only Item 1 introduces a new persisted entity. Items 2–4 add small in-memory/checkpointed agent state fields and reuse an existing movie attribute. mc-service data is unchanged.

---

## New entity — Application Settings (global)

**Store**: MongoDB collection `app_settings` (BFF-owned), a **single document**. External-contract names (collection + field keys) are stable and exempt from the behavior-descriptive-identifier rule (annotated in code).

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `_id` | string | Fixed sentinel `"global"` — exactly one settings document exists. |
| `allowSelfRegistration` | boolean | Whether user self-registration is permitted app-wide. **Absent document / absent field ⇒ treated as `true`** (default preserves current behavior, SC-004). |
| `updatedBy` | string \| null | Keycloak user UUID of the admin who last changed it (never username/email). Null before first write. |
| `updatedAt` | ISO-8601 string \| null | Timestamp of last change. Null before first write. |

**Access module**: `frontend/mcm-app/src/bff-server/app-settings-store.ts` (mirrors `agent-config-store.ts`):
- `getAppSettings(): Promise<AppSettings>` — reads the `"global"` doc; returns the default (`allowSelfRegistration:true`) when absent.
- `setAllowSelfRegistration(allowed: boolean, updatedBy: string): Promise<AppSettings>` — upserts the `"global"` doc with `updatedAt` stamped.

**Validation rules**:
- `allowSelfRegistration` must be a boolean (PATCH body validated; reject otherwise with a typed 400).
- Reads never fail-open on error in a way that *enables* a disabled state silently: an unexpected store error on the enforcement path (register) should be treated conservatively and surfaced (fail closed to "registration attempt refused with an error", not silently allowed) — decided in `register+api.ts` handling.

**Lifecycle / transitions**: `true ⇄ false` only, via admin PATCH. No deletion. First PATCH creates the document.

## Existing attribute reused — Movie.owned (Item 2)

No schema change. Confirms current behavior is honored:

- mc-service `domain/movie.rs`: `owned: bool`; `CreateMovieDto.owned` is `#[serde(default)]` ⇒ **false** when omitted; the create command passes it through unchanged.
- Cross-field invariant (unchanged): `owned=false` clears `owned_media` (`OwnedMediaWhenOwnedSpec`). The ownership Yes/No answer only sets `owned`; it does not set `owned_media`.
- Agent change: `to_movie_payload()` sets `owned` from the user's answer instead of the hardcoded `True`.

## Agent GraphState additions (Items 2 & 4) — checkpointed routing/UI state only

All fields hold UI/routing state only — **never tokens or credentials** (constitution §Identity Propagation). Added to `GraphState` in `graph.py` and cleared by the relevant `_*_STATE_RESET` dicts.

| Field | Item | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `add_stage` value `awaiting_ownership` (+ any stash field for the pending candidate/target/ownership answer) | 2 | Marks the add flow paused on the "Do you own this?" Yes/No; resolved on the next turn before building the proposal. Added to `_ADD_STATE_RESET` (in both `graph.py` and `approval_gate.py`). |
| `navigate_stage` | 4a | Marks the navigator paused on a "Which collection?" pick (mirrors `search_stage`/`import_stage`). Enables the `graph.py` continuation guard to keep the tap in the navigator. |
| `navigate_options` (or equivalent pending-prompt options) | 4a | The candidate collections offered, so the resumed bare-token tap resolves to the chosen collection. Cleared on resolution. |

---

## Agent import state change (Item 3) — handle instead of full dataset

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `import_context = { tabs, collections }` — the **entire parsed spreadsheet** (all rows) re-serialized into `GraphState` and checkpointed on every clarification turn. | A **transient handle/reference** to the parsed spreadsheet (reuse the spreadsheet-mcp transient `store`), checkpointed in place of the full dataset. The large row data lives behind the handle, not in per-turn checkpoint state. |

**Rationale**: bounds checkpoint size across many clarification turns on large files (Item 3 timeout cause).

**Lifetime invariant (FR-016)**: the handle MUST remain valid for the whole import session (every clarification turn), not just the first. If the backing transient store cannot guarantee this, refresh it per turn or checkpoint a minimal re-parse key that re-materializes the data deterministically. Guarded by a multi-turn resolution test (T019).

## Audit records (Item 1) — emitted, not stored by this feature

Via `logger.audit` (existing structured logger; not a new collection):
- `admin_setting_changed` — `{ setting:"allowSelfRegistration", value, userId (admin UUID), ip }` on PATCH.
- `registration_refused_disabled` — `{ userId?: n/a, ip }` when a registration attempt is refused because the setting is off (§Logging: audit access-denied/refusals).
- Admin-endpoint access-denied — a `logger.audit` event on the `admin/settings` 401 (unauth) and 403 (non-admin) paths (FR-007; may be emitted centrally by `requireAuth`/`requireMcAdmin` — confirm during T035).
