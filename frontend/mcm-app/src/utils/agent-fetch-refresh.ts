/**
 * Agent transport refresh-retry wrapper (feature 012).
 *
 * Auth model: BFF cookies (constitution §Frontend App "Client Auth Model", Option A — web AND
 * native). The agent /run request is credentialed because CopilotKit's RN streaming-fetch polyfill
 * uses `XMLHttpRequest`, whose `withCredentials` defaults to `true` in React Native, so the native
 * cookie jar's `mcm_access_token` rides along automatically (the polyfill itself does NOT read
 * `init.credentials` — the cookie is carried by RN's default, NOT by an explicit flag; if a future
 * RN/CopilotKit upgrade flips that default, this breaks silently → the android-e2e harness must
 * regression-cover it).
 *
 * The CopilotKit runtime fetch to `/bff-api/agent/run` does NOT go through the axios token-refresh
 * interceptor (`utils/token-refresh`), so when the short-lived `mcm_access_token` cookie expires
 * (Keycloak access-token lifespan, ~5 min) the agent route 401s. The refresh-token cookie is
 * `Path=/bff-api/auth/refresh`, so the only lever is client-side: on a `/run` 401, call
 * `silentRefresh()` (axios → /auth/refresh → BFF re-sets the cookies in the shared RN cookie jar)
 * and retry the run once with the fresh cookie. (Whether this recovery fires correctly on a real
 * mid-session expiry — vs the failures seen under the unstable Windows-Metro harness — is the open
 * item the android-e2e workflow exists to confirm: see diagnosis-mobile-agent-no-token.md.)
 *
 * `createRefreshingFetch` is a pure factory (inject baseFetch + refresh) so it is unit-testable
 * without any global. `installAgentFetchRefresh` wraps `globalThis.fetch` once, before CopilotKit
 * issues any run (called from `assistant-polyfills`, the first import).
